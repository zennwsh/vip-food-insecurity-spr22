# Composite index creation
This repository contains the scripts for creating an index that measures the self-sufficiency of each community district in achieving food security. This is for my work with the Vertically Integrated Project, Food Insecurity for Spring 22 under Prof. Alice Reznickova and Wythe Marschall. 

This is mainly for learning and cross-referencing purposes. 

The data used are confidential, hosted by NYU CUSP, so I am unable to share them here.
